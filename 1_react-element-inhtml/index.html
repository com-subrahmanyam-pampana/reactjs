<!-- 
Create Virtual DOM: 
The React.createElement() function is called to create a 
virtual representation of the React component 
(in this case, an <h1> element with the text "Hello, World!!!"). This virtual representation is an object that describes what the actual DOM should look like.

Render to Actual DOM: After creating the virtual DOM, 
ReactDOM.render() takes that virtual representation and 
compares it to the current state of the actual HTML DOM.
    
Diffing Process: React uses its diffing algorithm to 
determine what has changed between the virtual DOM and
the actual DOM. Since this is the first render, it will 
identify that the <h1> element needs to be added to the 
actual DOM.
    
Update Actual DOM: React then updates the actual DOM
 based on the differences identified. 
 In this case, it will create and insert the <h1> 
    element into the <div id="my_react_div">. -->
